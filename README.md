Diabetes Prediction System
This project is a simplified example of a diabetes prediction system using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. You can download it from [source_link_here] and save it as "diabetes_data.csv" in the project directory.

Running the Code
Clone the project repository.
Install the required dependencies if you haven't already (e.g., pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn).
Download the dataset and save it as "diabetes_data.csv" in the project directory.
Run the Python script: python diabetes_prediction.py.
Results
The code will train a random forest classifier on the dataset and provide accuracy and classification report as the evaluation results.
